# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        while root:
            if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
